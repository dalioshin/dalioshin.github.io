            <p>I am an maker, learner, and observer.
            </p>
            <p>I have 4 years of experience working as a software and machine learning engineer at Docusign.
                While there I learned valuable lessons about building scalable and reliable software. Since
                leaving I have been focused on my art absorbing as much about the stars and universe as I can,
                and then trying to squeeze those ideas into different mediums. The goal is to share that wonderful feeling
                of exploration and discovery with as many people as I can reach.  
                Before my industry experience I attended Rensselear Polytechnic Institute and graduated with a BS in Computer and 
                Systems Engineering. Before my university experience I was lucky to be surrounded by many great teachers,
                official and not, who encouraged my creative and technical spirit.
